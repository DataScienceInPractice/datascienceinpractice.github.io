    "## Why Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- As a general purpose language, Python supports a large range of tasks.\n",
    "    - Or put another way: 'Python isn't the best at anything, but it's second best at everything'\n",
    "    - This is useful. A data science project may include everything from scraping data from the web, analyzing a mixture or text and numerical data, computing features, training a model, creating high-quality graphs, and then hosting a website with your results. \n",
    "- Python is explicitly and by design, user-friendly.\n",
    "- Python also has a massive user community, who contribute to a large number of high-quality, well maintained open-source tools.\n",
    "    - The best language for your project is one which has the things you need.\n",
    "- In part for the reasons listed above, Python is heavily used in industry."
